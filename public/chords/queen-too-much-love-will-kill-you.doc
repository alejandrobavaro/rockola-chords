Queen - Too Much Love Will Kill You (Guitar Chords)
(Brian May/ Frank Musker e Elizabeth Lamers)

F7               A#               D#m            Gm7 
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be  
               D#m                       F               Gm 
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me  
  G#                       Dm 
I'm far away from home  
G#                                   Dm                     A# 
And I've been facing this alone for much too long  
     F7                A#           D#m               Gm7 
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me  
                     D#m                       F             Gm 
About growing up and what a struggle it would be  
  G#                            Dm 
In my tangled state of mind  
G#                                   Dm                    A#          
I've been looking back to find where I went wrong    
 A#                        D#m 
Too much love will kill you  
          A#                           F 
If you can't make up your mind  
A#                         D#m               A#                      F     
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind  
A#                         D#m                 A#                        F#m 
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs  
A#                         D#m            A# 
Too much love will kill you every time  
 
F7               A#               D#m            Gm7 
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be  
                 D#m                       F               Gm 
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me  
  G#                       Dm 
I used to bring you sunshine  
G#               Dm               A#   
Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh  
F7                A#                 D#m                   Gm7 
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes  
          D#m                       F               Gm 
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose  
 
G#                             Dm 
No there's no making sense of it  
G#               Dm                   A#      G#7 
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah  
A#                         D#m 
Too much love will kill you  
A#                             F 
Just as sure as none at all  
A#                                 D#m 
It'll drain the power that's in you  
A#                                           F 
Make you plead and scream and crawl  
A#                                 D#m   
And the pain will make you crazy  
A#                                   F#m 
You're the victim of your crime  
A#                         D#m          A# 
Too much love will kill you every time  
 
Solo da guitarra. 
 
        A#                         D#m 
Yeah too much love will kill you  
A#                           F 
It'll make your life a lie  
      A#                        D#m 
Yes too much love will kill you  
    A#                                F 
And you won't understand why  
A#                                              D#m 
You'd give your life you'd sell your soul  
A#                          F 
But here it comes again  
A#                        D#m 
Too much love will kill you  
           A#        D#m 
In the end  
           A#        D#m   A# 
In the end 

  F7           A#           D#m          Gm7          F            Gm
